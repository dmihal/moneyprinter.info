            <p className="contentTitle">About the Nakamoto Coefficient</p>
            <p className="content">
                First proposed by <a href="https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e">Balaji Srinavasan and Leland Lee</a> and named in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto,
                the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, the Nakamoto Coefficient is a measure of the smallest number of independent entities that can act collectively to shut down a blockchain.
                On a typical Proof-of-Stake network (like those listed here on Nakaflow), the Nakamoto Coefficient is defined by the number of node operators that, together, control more than
                one third (33.33%) of all stake on the network. <br/><br/>

                What does that mean for the data here on Nakaflow? If, for example, the current Nakamoto Coefficient for a given network is listed here as "10", then there are 10 node operators
                (often called "validators") who, together, control more than one third of stake on that network. With that much stake, these 10 node operators would have the option to join forces
                as bad actors and prevent the network from reaching consensus, thus halting the chain from adding new blocks and effectively shutting down the network. <br/><br/>

                Simply put: the higher the Nakamoto Coefficient on a network, the more resilient the network will be to these kinds of attacks. And the more resilient the network is to these kinds
                of attacks, the more decentralized and censorship-resistant it is.<br/>

            <p className="contentTitle">How We Calculate the Nakamoto Coefficient</p>
            <p className="content">
                Calculating the Nakamoto Coefficient is as much of an art as a science; it can be difficult to identify if, for example, any two nodes are being secretly run by one party, and various
                factors (such as node geography and cloud service provider) can affect the calculation. <br/><br/>

                On Nakaflow, we calculate the Nakamoto Coefficient based on available data around which entities‚Äîsuch as individual validator operators, like Chainflow, and stake pools, such as
                LIDO‚Äîcontrol staked tokens. <br/>

            <p className="contentTitle">Improving the Nakamoto Coefficient on Your Networks</p>
            <p className="content">
                To improve the Nakamoto Coefficient on your networks, please consider staking your tokens with smaller, independent validator operators who control a smaller proportion of stake.
                Here are two simple ways to do so: <br/><br/>
                1. Use block explorers to identify validator operators outside of the top ten stake-holders, and stake directly with them. <br/>
                2. Use algorithmic stake pools that automatically redistribute your stake to high-performing smaller validators. <br/><br/>

                As token-holders, we can all do our part to support decentralization on our networks. <a href="https://twitter.com/chainflowpos">#KeepStakeDecentralized üí™</a> <br/>
